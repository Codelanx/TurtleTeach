# TurtleTeach  - SWEN-444 Prototype

#### Available Online! See: [https://home.rogue.ninja/turtleteach/](https://home.rogue.ninja/turtleteach/)

# 1. Setup

Note that TurtleTeach is a [hosted product, available online](https://home.rogue.ninja/turtleteach/);
end-users should not have to go through the installation process.

For users (/graders) installing on their own, simply clone the code from the github repository into a desired location:

    git clone https://github.com/Codelanx/TurtleTeach.git

Once the download is complete, change into the cloned directory, and install dependencies:

    npm install

Following that, you can start the development server on your local machine via:

    npm start

Finally, you can access TurtleTeach in your browser locally:

    http://localhost:3011       | Note: We use port 3011, but this can be changed


# 2. Usage

With a running application underway, once you have navigated to the URL for the TurtleTeach
page, simply log in with one of the premade trial accounts, while keeping note of their
level of support:
   

 * `Student`: Majority of interfaces completed, but some visual tweaks remain. A couple
    pages were stripped down/incomplete, for the sake of finalizing the other pages within our
   allotted time.
 * `Teacher`: All teacher-specific interfaces are implemented.
 * `Creator`: Few to none in terms of interface support. This work role was out of scope for
    our prototype.
 
To log in, click "Login / Register" in the top right, enter one of the above `Username`s into
the username field (on the /login page), and enter any password that you prefer. The password is
not authenticated, any password (even blank) will be acceptable to log in with.


From there you are free to explore. Some of the links (usually, green buttons) and pages are currently non-functional,
however the website should be fully navigable.
